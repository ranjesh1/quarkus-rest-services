# Getting started with Quarkus

This is a minimal CRUD service exposing a couple of endpoints over REST.

Under the hood, this demo uses:

- RESTEasy to expose the REST endpoints
- REST-assured and JUnit 5 for endpoint testing

## Requirements

To compile and run this demo you will need:

- JDK 11+
- GraalVM

In addition, you will need either a PostgreSQL database, or Docker to run one.

### Configuring GraalVM and JDK 11+

Make sure that both the `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables have
been set, and that a JDK 11+ `java` command is on the path.

See the [Building a Native Executable guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide)
for help setting up your environment.

## Building the application

Launch the Maven build on the checked out sources of this demo:

> ./mvnw package

### Live coding with Quarkus

The Maven Quarkus plugin provides a development mode that supports
live coding. To try this out:

> ./mvnw quarkus:dev

This command will leave Quarkus running in the foreground listening on port 8080.

In this mode you can make changes to the code and have the changes immediately applied, by just refreshing your browser.



### Run Quarkus in JVM mode

When you're done iterating in developer mode, you can run the application as a
conventional jar file.

First compile it:

> ./mvnw package

Next we need to make sure you have a PostgreSQL instance running (Quarkus automatically starts one for dev and test mode). To set up a PostgreSQL database with Docker:

> docker run -it --rm=true --name quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_USER=quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_DB=quarkus_test -p 5432:5432 postgres:13.3 


Then run it:

> java -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar

Have a look at how fast it boots, or measure the total native memory consumption.


###  To test application manually
Use Postman or any other REST client to send POST request with the following details

URL : http://localhost:8080/api/users

Request Body

{
"firstName":"Steve",

"lastName":"Rob",

"email":"steverob@test.com",

"firstLineOfAddress":"111 Pinewood Grove",

"secondLineOfAddress":"Commercial street",

"town":"London",

"postCode":"W7 8AG"

}


### Run Quarkus as a native executable

You can also create a native executable from this application without making any
source code changes. A native executable removes the dependency on the JVM:
everything needed to run the application on the target platform is included in
the executable, allowing the application to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compiling a native executable takes a bit longer, as GraalVM performs additional
steps to remove unnecessary codepaths. Use the  `native` profile to compile a
native executable:

> ./mvnw package -Dnative

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this executable directly:

> ./target/quarkus-rest-services-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
